#PSUDP(Problem Solve Using Advance Python)
🐍 Advanced Python OOPs – Daily Learning Tracker
Welcome to my Advanced Python – Object Oriented Programming learning repository!
This repo contains my day-wise Python OOPs practice, covering concepts from basic class definitions to advanced object-oriented programming techniques. Each day includes key topics and related code files for quick revision and hands-on practice.

📅 Day 1: Introduction to OOPs in Python
🧠 Agenda:
Classes and Objects, User-Defined Classes, Class Variables vs Instance Variables, Instance Methods, Class Methods (@classmethod), Static Methods (@staticmethod), Constructors and Parameterized Constructors
📂 Code Topics Covered:
class_and_object.py → Creating basic class and object
constructor.py → Default and parameterized constructors
class_vs_instance_var.py → Difference between instance and class variables
method_types.py → Instance, class, and static methods

📅 Day 2: Deeper Dive into OOPs
🧠 Agenda:
Magic Methods in Python (like __str__, __add__, __repr__, etc.), Object as an Argument, Instances as Return Values,
Namespaces in Python
📂 Code Topics Covered:
magic_methods.py → Using dunder methods like __init__, __str__, __add__
object_as_argument.py → Passing objects to methods/functions
return_instance.py → Returning instance from methods
namespaces.py → Understanding local, global, and built-in namespaces
